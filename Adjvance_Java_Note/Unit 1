JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide 
range of databases.

Components in JDBC
Driver Manager = Loads database drivers and manages the connection between the application and the driver
Driver = A SQL statement to perform a query or update operation.
MetaDt = Information about returned data, the database and the drive.

Statement interface :
he Statement interface provides methods to execute queries with the database. The statement interface is a factory of ResultSet i.e. it provides factory method to get the object of ResultSet.
1) public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql): is used to execute SELECT query. It returns the object of ResultSet.
2) public int executeUpdate(String sql): is used to execute specified query, it may be create, drop, insert, update, delete etc.
3) public boolean execute(String sql): is used to execute queries that may return multiple results.

Connection interface :
A Connection is a session between a Java application and a database. It helps to establish a connection with the database.
JDBC allows any number of connections to different databases

Driver Interface and DriverManager Class

PreparedStatement :
PreparedStatement is a subclass of statement interface.
Used to execute pre-compiled SQL statements. For a faster andefficient statement execution precompilation is allowed.

ResultSet interface :
The tuple is received, and its contents can be examined byexecuting the java code.
The connectivity is an important issue but found transparent to anapplication developer.

ResultSetMetaData Interface
The user can get information about the types and properties of thecolumns in a ResultSet object
