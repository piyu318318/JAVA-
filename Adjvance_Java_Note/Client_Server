InetAdrress is used to get the IP address for host example www.abc.com we can  get IPaddress of class this class using InetAdress.
Factory methods in InetAdress 
static InetAddress getLocalHost() throws UnknownHostException
static InetAddress getByName (String hostName)throws UnknownHostException
static InetAddress[] getAllByName (String hostName)throws UnknownHostException

Instance Method
The InetAddress class also has other methods, which can be used on the objects returned by the methods.
boolean equals(Object other)
byte[] getAddress()

boolean isMulticastAddress()
String toString()

TCP/IP sockets are used to implement reliable,bidirectional, persistent, point-to-point, streambased connections between hosts on the Internet.
A socket can be used to connect Java’s I/O system to other programs that may reside either on the local machine or other machine on the Internet.

client - Socket()
Server - ServerSocket() constructors ServerSocket(int port),ServerSocket(int port,int maxQueue), ServerSocket(int port, int maxQueue, InetAddress localAddress)
ServerSocket has accept() method, which is ablocking call that will wait for a client to initiatecommunications, and then return with a normalSocket that is then used
for communication with the client.


InetAddress getInetAddress()
int getPort() 
int getLocalPort() 


Both these streams are used exactly like the I/O streams to send and receive data.
getInputStream(),getOutputStream()


Format of URL consist of four components
1. Protocol to use, separated from the rest of the locator by
a colon (:). Common protocols are- http, ftp and file.
2. Host name or IP address of the host to use which is

right by the slash (/) or optionally a colon (:).
3. Port number is an optional parameter, delimited on the
left from the host name by a colon (:) and on the right
by slash (/).
4. The actual file path.


Several constructors of Java’s URL class can throw
a MalformedURLException.
• One of the commonly used form specifies the URL
with a string that is identical to what you see
displayed in a web browser:
URL (String urlSpecifier) throws MalformedURLException
